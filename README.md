## Azure service used:
### Static Web Apps
Azure Static Web Apps publishes a website by building an app from a code repository. It automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.
Static web apps are commonly built using libraries and frameworks like Angular or React where server side rendering is not required. These apps include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
image assets that make up the application. With a traditional web server, these assets are served from a single server alongside any required API endpoints.

But as I use Static Web Apps, static assets are separated from a traditional web server and are instead served from points geographically distributed around the world. This distribution makes
serving files much faster as files are physically closer to end users. Azure interacts directly with GitHub to monitor a branch of your choice. Every time we push commits or accept pull requests into the watched branch, a build
is automatically run and your app is deployed to Azure. So, it makes the whole task easy.
